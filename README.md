Certificate in Advanced Football Tactical Analysis (Barça Innovation Hub)

Certificate in Virtual Reality (Goldsmiths, University of London)

With the creation of alternative virtual football world through the channel of Pro Evolution Soccer, inherit and transform the dream of immersively journeying into the football world at the parallel universe that originated from 2008. Rely on the immersion of the virtual football world to reflect and conclude on the interdependence, intersectionality, and undisclosed interactions between the alternative reality and the perceived reality, and fundamentally balance and integrate myself to freely traverse between them with the carries of all the meanings behind them.

Diversely and vastly engage and wholeheartedly place the self into the multiple virtual worlds that mainly bolstered by the gaming techniques. And through the continuous and progressing immersions, realize them essentially as the whole unity that not only supplement the meanings of real world, but more critically, reconstruct, complete, and transform the reality being overly perceived. Philosophically and aesthetically reflect on the world and self through the powerful impressions and inspirations from the breadth, splendor and grandiosity of the virtual worlds, which these valuable sources also serve as the important part of the self enlightenment. Dedicate to seamlessly connect the virtual worlds and world in reality, and ultimately being thrived in both of them through their established interdependence and interconnections, and meanwhile faithfully pursuing the co-living in that two kinds of worlds.
